Don’t get me wrong, it’s good. It’s very good. But you can do great and great is what I’m after.

I see this as a great adventure we are on together and we are so close. It just needs a bit more work in the studio.

I think what you are doing is significant and I’m so pleased to be part of it.

I do love the way your work is so open ended but we need some sort of closure here if I’m to make a selection. A bit more studio time I think.

So organic, so suggestive. I love it.
